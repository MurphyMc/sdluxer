# SDLuxer

SDLuxer is an SDL multiplexer using the Lux/lux-gui Lightweight User
eXperience library.

You run SDLuxer, and it acts like a window manager using Lux.  Then you run
SDL applications compiled with an SDLuxer-aware version of SDL, and their
windows show up inside SDLuxer.

See https://github.com/MurphyMc/libsdl for a version of SDL that works with
SDLuxer.
